# HENRYS NEWS REACT FRONTEND

The backend for this repo, created with JS, Mongo and Mongoose, is available here: https://github.com/LeaveTheCapital/henrys-news-backend/

The goal for this project was to create a Reddit-style news aggregator website using React, managing state efficiently and using declaritive components. I also wanted to explore responsive CSS and the Bootstrap library, while not forgetting my roots - I included some tips of the cap towards classic 90s HTML web design.

This project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the React code up and running on your local machine for testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the website live via Heroku.

### Installing

Run npm install in the command line to get the required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

To launch the development server, run the start script

```
npm start
```


This will open the app in your browser at this address:

```
localhost:3000/
```

## Deployment

To deploy on a live system, set up a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) app and link it to your fork of this GitHub repo.
